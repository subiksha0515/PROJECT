        "**Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Smart Emergency Assistant is designed to automate luggage insurance claim verification. It leverages image analysis and AI-based decision logic to determine whether a luggage item qualifies for insurance claims. By analyzing uploaded images along with file metadata and keywords, the system reduces manual processing, accelerates claim approval, and ensures accuracy in verifying luggage type and characteristics. This model improves customer satisfaction while minimizing fraudulent claim risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement**\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to predict the validity of luggage insurance claims by analyzing uploaded images. The system evaluates luggage type, size, and file metadata, then determines claim eligibility based on pre-defined thresholds and keywords. This approach ensures rapid claim assessment, reduces human error, and prevents fraudulent or ineligible claims. By using AI-based image validation combined with metadata checks, the system simplifies insurance claim workflows while improving accuracy and efficiency in real-world insurance operations.\n",
